## Description

Brain games is a set of five math games.
Each game consists of three rounds.

List of games:

- Brain even - the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer `yes`, if the number is even, or `no`, if it is odd.
- Brain calc - the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example `35 + 16`, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.
- Brain gcd - the user is shown two random numbers, for example `25 50`. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
- Brain progression - we show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.
- Brain prime - the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer `yes` if the number is prime, or `no` if it is not prime.
